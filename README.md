# MC_Expanded_Recipes

Welcome to the Minecraft Expanded Recipes Add-On page!

Here, you can find extra recipe files relating to the recipe mechanic in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. All but a few file types are in the JSON format, so there's not too much complexity.

Item or block recipes that have been added are:
- Enchanted Golden Apple
- Leather
- Sponge
- Water (source block)
- XP Bottle
- Wooden Blocks and Assortments
